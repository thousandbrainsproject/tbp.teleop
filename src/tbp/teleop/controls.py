    The buttons are rebuilt each time the user is asked to choose, so only the choices
    that can act this step are shown rather than greyed out. The four exploration
    headings (up / down / left / right) wrap around the RGB patch as a D-pad, each
    pointing the way it moves the sensor. A centered "jump" button appears whenever the
    model proposes a hypothesis-testing jump, and a centered "End episode" button is
    always present.

    `override_action` blocks on the figure's event loop until a button is clicked or its
    keyboard shortcut is pressed (WASD or arrow keys for the headings, space for jump,
    delete for end episode). The matplotlib quit keys (q) still close the figure window.
    The interactive policy is built up front, so an unsupported policy fails at
    construction rather than mid-episode.

    A persistent `Step Multiplier` slider centered beneath the D-pad scales the
    exploration headings' step size: the executed action is the policy's default step
    times the slider multiplier. The slider is built once and its value carries across
    steps; jumps are unaffected.
