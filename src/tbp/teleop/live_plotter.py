    """Live plotter implementing the `Plotter` Protocol for training and inference.

    Renders a 3-section view of the selected input channel of the displayed
    learning module. You can switch both the displayed learning module and the selected
    input channel at runtime with two cycling buttons under the `Step N` title. The
    learning module and channel are discovered from the model rather than configured by
    id.

    - Simulator: view finder and RGB patch of the sensor module feeding the selected
      (or, for an LM channel, the displayed LM's first sensor) channel.
    - Monty: the main graph of the selected channel, with an "Input Feature" corner
      inset showing the live feature on that channel (a 2D edge, a 3D surface, or, for a
      learning-module channel, the name of the object being passed). During an
      exploratory step the main graph is the channel's buffer points; during a
      matching step it is the most likely hypothesis graph plus its location marker.
    - Details: during an exploratory step, a per-channel stack of the other channels'
      buffers, each carrying the same "Input Feature" inset as the Monty section; during
      a matching step, the displayed LM's per-object evidence and number-of-hypotheses
      line plots.

    A non-interactive plotter exposes a `Speed` slider; an interactive plotter instead
    shows the four exploration heading buttons (plus a jump button when one is offered
    and "End episode") and overrides the executed action via `override_action`.

    When the displayed learning module lacks the evidence-LM inference API, the Monty
    and Details matching-step panels degrade to a placeholder rather than raising.
